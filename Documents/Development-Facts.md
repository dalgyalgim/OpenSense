# Why projects for x64 architecture have both `Platforms` and `PlatformTarget` attributes?

`Platforms` means nothing for assembly. It is used and generated by Visual Studio Configuration Manager for seperating different sets of build settings (configuration-platform pair).
C++/CLR projects have default configurations that use "x64" as its platform name, so a platform called "x64" other than regular "AnyCPU" will present in Configuration Manager.
In OpenSense, `Platforms` attribute is also set for C# projects to uniform the representations of C# and C++/CLR x64 projects in Configuration Manger. Removing this attribute will not change any value in output DLL files.

`PlatformTarget` makes the resulting assembly targeting to `AMD64` instead of `MSIL`, which is written to project output DLL files.
