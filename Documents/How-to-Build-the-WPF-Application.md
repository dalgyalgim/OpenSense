# How to build the WPF application

## Dependencies

The WPF application project references all available OpenSense components at default.
So you need to satisfy all the prerequisites to successfully build and run the application.

A set of minimal dependencies is provided as comment in the `.csproj` file.
You can replace the project reference list with references in the comment.

## Build

Open the file `OpenSense.sln` with Visual Studio.

You may see security warnings like this.

*This may because this VS solution contains native C++ projects.*

If a retarget dialog is shown, select `No Upgrade` for all.

*We once upgraded them to VS 2019 Toolset, but found some native functions does not work.*

Select project `WpfApplication` and set it to be the startup project (by right click on it and click `Set as Startup Project`).

Then you can build the solution.

## Run

Once you successfully build OpenSense, you may run it.

You need to install Kinect SDK, if you see a runtime error like this.
