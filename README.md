# OpenSense

Automatic multimodal acquisition and understanding of social signals is an essential building block for natural and effective human-machine collaboration and communication. OpenSense is a platform for real-time multimodal acquisition and recognition of social signals. OpenSense enables precisely synchronized and coordinated acquisition and processing of human behavioral signals. Powered by the Microsoft's [Platform for Situated Intelligence](https://github.com/microsoft/psi), OpenSense supports a range of sensor devices and machine learning tools and encourages developers to add new components to the system through straightforward mechanisms for component integration. This platform also offers an intuitive graphical user interface to build application pipelines from existing components. OpenSense is freely available for academic research.
